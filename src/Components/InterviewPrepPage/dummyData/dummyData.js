          to solve problems and improve people's lives.

          requirements, to designing and implementing solutions,
          to testing and maintaining the final product.
          <br />I find it particularly satisfying to see the
          impact of my work on users and the positive difference
          it can make in their lives.
          <br />

      question: ` Do you like to work in a team? What would be a perfect team for you?`,
      answer: `I think it's important for developers to be able to work
    well in teams.
    
    Working in a team allows for different perspectives and
    ideas to be shared, which can lead to better solutions.
    
    It also allows for more efficient problem-solving, as
    team members can divide up the work and leverage each
    other's strengths.

    enjoyable and motivating than working alone.

  // Technical Questions

  [
    {
      number: 1,
      question:
        'What is the difference between a variable declared with `var` and one declared with `let` or `const`?',
      answer:
        '`var` variables are function-scoped, while `let` and `const` variables are block-scoped. This means that a variable declared with `var` is accessible within the entire function, while a variable declared with `let` or `const` is only accessible within the block in which it is defined. Additionally, variables declared with `const` are read-only and cannot be reassigned, while `let` variables can be reassigned.',
    },

    {
      number: 2,
      question: 'How would you explain closures in JavaScript?',
      answer:
        'A closure is a function that has access to the variables in its parent scope, even after the parent function has returned. This allows for data to be retained across multiple function calls and for functions to continue to have access to the variables they need, even after the parent function has completed.',
    },
    {
      number: 3,
      question: 'What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?',
      answer:
        '`==` compares values for equality, while `===` compares both values and types. This means that `==` will perform type coercion if necessary, while `===` will only return true if the operands have the same value and type.',
    },
    {
      number: 4,
      question: 'How do you declare a function in JavaScript?',
      answer:
        "There are multiple ways to declare a function in JavaScript, including using the `function` keyword, using arrow function syntax, and using the `Function()` constructor. Some examples include `function myFunction() { ... }`, `const myFunction = () => { ... }`, and `const myFunction = new Function('...')`.",
    },
    {
      number: 5,
      question:
        'How would you explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?',
      answer:
        'Synchronous code is executed in the order it is written, with the program blocking until each line is completed before moving on to the next. Asynchronous code, on the other hand, allows for multiple tasks to be executed at the same time, rather than waiting for one task to complete before moving on to the next. This is commonly used for tasks such as file I/O, network requests, and timers.',
    },
    {
      number: 6,
      question:
        'What is the difference between a promise and a callback in JavaScript?',
      answer:
        'A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the outer function has completed. A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and it can be used to register callbacks that will be called when the promise is fulfilled or rejected.',
    },
    {
      number: 7,
      question: 'What is event bubbling in JavaScript?',
      answer:
        'Event bubbling is a way for events to propagate from the innermost element, to the outermost element. It means that when an event is fired on a child element, it will trigger on the parent element as well.',
    },
    {
      number: 8,
      question: 'What is a promise in JavaScript?',
      answer:
        'A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to handle asynchronous operations in a more synchronous way, by chaining callbacks together.',
    },
    {
      number: 9,
      question: 'What is the difference between map and filter in JavaScript?',
      answer:
        '`map` returns an array with the same number of elements, where each element is the result of the callback function. `filter` returns an array with a subset of the elements, where the callback function returns true.',
    },
    {
      number: 10,
      question:
        'What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?',
      answer:
        'Synchronous code is executed one line at a time, in the order it appears in the script. Asynchronous code can be executed out of order, or in parallel with other code. It allows your program to continue running while it waits for a long-running operation to complete, like an API request.',
    },
