    question: 'Why did you choose to be a developer?',
    answer: `As a developer, I have a passion for using technology
          to solve problems and improve people's lives.
          <br />I enjoy the process of creating and building
          software, from understanding user needs and defining
          requirements, to designing and implementing solutions,
          to testing and maintaining the final product.
          <br />I find it particularly satisfying to see the
          impact of my work on users and the positive difference
          it can make in their lives.
          <br />
          Additionally, I am constantly learning new
          technologies, methodologies, and best practices which
          make the job challenging and enjoyable.`,

    question:
      ' Do you like to work in a team? What would be a perfect team for you?',
    answer: `I think it's important for developers to be able to work
    well in teams.
    <br />
    Working in a team allows for different perspectives and
    ideas to be shared, which can lead to better solutions.
    <br />
    It also allows for more efficient problem-solving, as
    team members can divide up the work and leverage each
    other's strengths.
    <br />
    Additionally, working in a team environment can be more
    enjoyable and motivating than working alone.
    <br />
    So it is important for a developer to be able to
    communicate effectively and be able to work together
    with others.`,
