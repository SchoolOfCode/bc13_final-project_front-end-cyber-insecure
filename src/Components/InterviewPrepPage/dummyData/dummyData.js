    question:
      ' Do you like to work in a team? What would be a perfect team for you?',
    answer: `I think it's important for developers to be able to work
    well in teams.
    <br />
    Working in a team allows for different perspectives and
    ideas to be shared, which can lead to better solutions.
    <br />
    It also allows for more efficient problem-solving, as
    team members can divide up the work and leverage each
    other's strengths.
    <br />
    Additionally, working in a team environment can be more
    enjoyable and motivating than working alone.
    <br />
    So it is important for a developer to be able to
    communicate effectively and be able to work together
    with others.`,
